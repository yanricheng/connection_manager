/**
 * Surrogate of the main server where the Connection Manager is routing client
 * packets. This class is responsible for keeping a pool of working threads to
 * processing incoming clients traffic and forward it to the main server. Each working
 * thread uses its own connection to the server. By default 5 threads/connections
 * are established to the server. Use the system property <tt>xmpp.manager.connections</tt>
 * to modify the default value.<p>
 *
 * ServerSurrogate is also responsible for caching the server configuration such as if
 * non-sasl authentication or in-band registration are available.<p>
 *
 * Each connection to the server has its own {@link ServerPacketReader} to read incoming
 * traffic from the server. Incoming server traffic is then handled by
 * {@link ServerPacketHandler}.
